2. The Martyrdom: Sambhajiâ€™s Brave Stand Against Aurangzeb
One of the most powerful and tragic stories of Sambhaji Maharaj is his final stand against Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.

In 1689, Sambhaji was captured by the Mughal forces due to betrayal. Aurangzeb offered him a deal: convert to Islam and he would be spared, given a high post, and allowed to live in comfort.

Sambhaji refused outright, declaring that he would never abandon his dharma (religion) or his people's freedom. Enraged, Aurangzeb ordered him to be tortured and executed in the most brutal manner.

For 40 days, Sambhaji was subjected to horrific torture, yet he never gave in, never begged for mercy, and never renounced his faith or nation. Finally, he was killed on 11 March 1689.

His martyrdom became a symbol of unwavering courage, self-respect, and resistance against tyranny, and he is revered as a Dharmaveer (protector of dharma) to this day.
